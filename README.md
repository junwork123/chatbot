# Core Packages

- `domain` : this package is `focusing on Subject` like playing a Music, telling a joke or notice on Something via `Controller & Service`.

- `platform` : this package is implementation of ChatBot interfaces depend on specific platform such as Discord, Slack or Line.

# Core Concept

- `Command` : Command is Enum class for predefined Actions. it has a Meta-Info values for filtering or finding a controller.  

- `@CommandMapping` : This annotation helps us find controller and method to be executed. it needs String Value named `startCommand` matching `Command`. 

- `@ChatBotController` : Actually, This annotation is same as `@Controller`, But it could help `Dispatcher` and distinguish `@ChatBotController` from `@Controller` when Dispatcher finds a controller.     

- `ChatBotDispather` : this interface has 2 methods. One is `dispatch` for finding controller and method to be executed. Another is `onMessage` to invoke them.
